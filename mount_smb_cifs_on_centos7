Mounting the Samba share
To mount a Samba share on Linux first you need to install the cifs-utils package.

On Ubuntu and Debian run:

sudo apt install cifs-utils
Copy
On CentOS and Fedora run:


sudo yum install cifs-utils
Copy
Next, create a mount point:

sudo mkdir /mnt/smbmount
Copy
Mount the share using the following command:

sudo mount -t cifs -o username=username //samba_hostname_or_server_ip/sharename /mnt/smbmount
Copy
For example to mount a share named josh on a Samba server with IP address 192.168.121.118 as user josh to the /mnt/smbmount mount point you would run:

sudo mount -t cifs -o username=josh //192.168.121.118/josh /mnt/smbmount
Copy
You will be prompted to enter the user password.

Password for josh@//192.168.121.118/josh:  ********
