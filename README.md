My name is Alex Pavlov. 
I am a professional data engineer and DWH developer with extensive experience in building and maintaining data pipelines and warehouses. I have worked with various columnar and analytic databases, such as Clickhouse, Greenplum and Vertica, to store and process large volumes of structured and unstructured data. I have also used Python as my primary programming language for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization. I have leveraged the power of Kafka (including such framework as Debezium) to stream and capture data changes from different sources and deliver them to the target systems. I have deployed and managed my data solutions on cloud platforms, such as Azure or AWS, using their services and tools. I have also provided data insights and recommendations to stakeholders and clients based on the results of my data engineering projects.
